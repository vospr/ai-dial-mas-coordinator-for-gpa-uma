        # ℹ️ Cool thing about DIAL that all the apps that implement /chat/completions endpoint within DIAL infrastructure
        #    can be openai compatible and DIAL SDK supports us with creation of such applications. So, we can use any
        #    OpenAI compatible client (from openai, azureopenai, langchain, whatever...) and communicate with it like
        #    with openai LLM through /chat/completions endpoint.
        #    BZW this app as well implements /chat/completions endpoint.
        # ---
        # 1. Create AsyncDial (api_version='2025-01-01-preview')
        # 2. Make call, you will need to provide such parameters:
        #       - it should stream response
        #       - prepared messages with `additional_instructions`
        #       - `general-purpose-agent` is deployment name that we will call
        #          Full final URL will be `http://host.docker.internal:8052/openai/deployments/general-purpose-agent/chat/completions`
        #       - extra_headers={'x-conversation-id': request.headers.get('x-conversation-id')}
        #         Extra headers are required in this case since we have the logic in GPA for RAG that requires them
        # 3. Create such variables:
        #       - content, here we will collect content
        #       - result_custom_content: CustomContent with empty attachment list, here we will collect attachments
        #       - stages_map: dict[int, Stage] = {}, here we will the mirrored stages by their indexes
        # 4. Make async loop through chunks and:
        #       - get delta and print it to console it will later help you to see what is coming in response from GPA
        #       - if delta has content append it to the `stage`
        #       - if delta has custom_content it is time for magic✨
        #           - if custom_content has attachments then add them to the `result_custom_content` (we will deal with them later)
        #           - if custom_content has state, as well add it to `result_custom_content`. It is important for us
        #             since here persisted all the tool calls information that is required to GPA to restore the context
        #           - And now is magic, we will propagate stages from GPA to out MAS coordinator:
        #               - make dict with none excluded from the custom_content
        #               - if it has 'stages':
        #                   - iterate through them (iterated stage we will name as `stg`) and:
        #                       - get 'index' from it (each stage has it is index, it is required param)
        #                       - if `stages_map` contains Stage by such index then:
        #                           - if `stg` has 'content' then append it to the Stage by index
        #                           - if `stg` has 'attachments' then iterate through these attachments and add them to the Stage by index
        #                           - if stg` has 'status' and it is 'completed' then close the stage by index (StageProcessor.close_stage_safely)
        #                       - otherwise: we need to open the Stage on our side to propagate GPA Stage data, use
        #                         StageProcessor and don't forget to put it to the `stages_map` by index
        # 5. Propagate `result_custom_content` to choice.
        #    ⚠️ Here is the moment that aidial_client.AsyncDial and aidial_sdk has different pydentic models (classes)
        #       for Attachment, so, you can make such move to handle it `Attachment(**attachment.dict(exclude_none=True))`
        # 6. Now we need to to save information about conversation with GPA to the MASCoordinator choice state. Create
        #    dict {_IS_GPA: True, GPA_MESSAGES: result_custom_content.state} and set it to the choice state.
        # 7. Return assistant message with content

        # 2. Make for i loop through range of len of request messages and:
        #       - if it is assistant message then:
        #           - Check if it has custom content and it has state:
        #               - if state dict has `_IS_GPA` and it is true then:
        #                   - 1. add to `res_messages` `request.messages[idx-1]` as dict with none excluded. Here we
        #                     add user message
        #                   - 2. make deepcopy of message, then set copied message with state from _GPA_MESSAGES add to
        #                     `res_messages`. What we do here is to restore appropriate format of assistant message for
        #                     GPA: {_IS_GPA: True, GPA_MESSAGES: {'tool_call_history': [{...}]}} -> {'tool_call_history': [{...}]}
        # 3. Add last message from `additional_instructions` (it will be user message) as dict with none excluded
        # 4. If `additional_instructions` are present we need to make augmentation for last message content in the `res_messages`
        # 5. Return `res_messages`
